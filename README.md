this is my first webstack_portfolio_project the first thing you will see when you enter the world of chatty is the register page that you can insert your username, email and password then after you register you will be redirected to the login page to reinsert you username and password you made previously in the register after that the login page will redirect you to the contact page that you can choose whom you want to chat with. and just by clicking the person to chat with the chat page will appear on your screen and you can start enjoying the connection.
